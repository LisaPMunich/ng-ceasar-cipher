# Caesar Cipher

## Description

In this project I created a Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder. It allows users to input a message and a shift value, and then uses the Caesar Cipher method to encode the message. The encoded message can then be decoded by inputting the message and the shift value again.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to input a message and shift value to encode it
* As a user, I want to see the encoded message once it's been encoded
* As a user, I want to be able to input the encoded message and shift value to decode it
* As a user, I want to be able to clear the input fields and start over

## Features

* Encoding and decoding of messages using the Caesar Cipher method
* Button to clear input fields and start over
* Loading spinner while the message is being encoded

## How to run it locally

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies
* Run ng serve to start a local development server
* Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to view the app
